1. Tagging rows — for the time being this is a no-go, he asked if you could create a tutorial that shows basically splitting up the file using excel and then uploading the file one bit at a time and tagging each bit as it’s tagged now

2/3. Beign able to select which unit you're using for each number/conversion, displaying such unit in the chart you're visualizing, and saving those units/conversions

ok so I’ll put back in that normalization allowing you to change the name of the column
so then the use can just change the name of the column to include the unit
i.e. weight_kg or total feet or whatever

4. storing the data type in the file upload — not necessary as it’s already displayed in dataviz anyways plus converted during the upload

5. SToring images so they don’t have to be replaced on every update — aaron is working on this now

6. drill down for pie graph — I will try and see if I can get it working today / tommorow, if not we will have to push it

7. drag and drop seems to duplicate data

8. add widgets, just add one at a time
